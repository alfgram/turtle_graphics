My extension lets the user draw to the screen using the arrow or WASD keys.
Forward/A draws a line forward and left/D and right/W change the rotation of the player. Pressing enter closes the window.
Once finished drawing, the forward and directional commands are written to Extension/extension.ttl.
This file is a valid .ttl file and can be ran using the interpreter to redraw the exact same thing as inputted by the user.

Testing was carried out purely by checking the output file against what arrow keys were pressed when the program was ran.
