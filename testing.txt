parse purely checks whether the .ttl files follows the grammar.
interp flags up additional errors (invalid infix notation, uninitialized variables)

Error messages:
If an error is flagged, the .ttl file is printed to the terminal with the line in which the error occurred highlighted in red.
The highlighted line number should provide the user with enough information to find the source of the error.
A brief explanation of the error is also printed below.

Testing:
Assertion testing was carried out on each individual functions as the code was written to ensure it performed correctly and to avoid bugs later on.
The majority of testing was done via test .ttl files in the test_files folder.
A set of valid files were used to check the parser and to visually inspect the SDL output to ensure it behaved as expected.
I have also messed around with .ttl files to try and create some more complex patterns in later valid file numbers.
Assertion testing was used on invalid files to check each file gave the correct error code and line number in which the error occurred.
